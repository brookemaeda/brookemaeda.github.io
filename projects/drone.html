<p>The mission of this project is to have an unmanned aerial vehicle fly autonomously while searching for targets.  It then releases an unmanned ground vehicle to a target in order to deliver a payload.  This team consisted of students from various majors such as electrical, civil, and mechanical engineering.  It was also a vertically integrated project which means there was a faculty member, graduate students researchers, and undergraduates of all levels.  The goal is to compete in an annual competition in Maryland during the summer.  The competition focuses on a search-and-rescue mission where teams are scored based on aspects such as navigating waypoints autonomously, taking in-flight pictures, and detecting targets.</p>

<p>I first learned about this project when faculty spoke at my freshman dorm.  I became interested and was able to join for my freshman project.  Since I am a Computer Engineering major, I joined the Image Processing subsystem which focused on target recognition.</p>

<p>As a member of the Image Processing subsystem, my main tasks included creating training images for the object detection algorithm.  During my second year, I was also part of pilot and mission operations training.  In pilot training we learned how to properly man a fixed-wing drone in the case that during autonomous flight we need to take over.  Through mission operations training, I learned how all of the subsystems worked together to create a complete team and how each section is important in their own way.  We also learned how to manage team flight practices.</p>
