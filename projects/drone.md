The mission of this project is to have an unmanned aerial vehicle fly autonomously while searching for targets.  It then releases an unmanned ground vehicle to a target in order to deliver a payload.  I was part of the Image Processing subsystem which focused on target recognition.  One of my main tasks included creating training images for the object detection algorithm.  I was also part of pilot and mission operations training.  In pilot training we learned how to properly man a fixed-wing drone in the case that during autonomous flight we need to take over.  Through mission operations training, I learned how all of the subsystems worked together to create a complete team and how each section is important in their own way.  We also learned how to manage team flight practices.
