summary: "An academic project I worked on throughout my freshman and sophomore year."

The mission of this project is to have an unmanned aerial vehicle fly autonomously while searching for targets.  It then releases an unmanned ground vehicle to a target in order to deliver a payload.  I was part of the Image Processing subsystem which focused on target recognition.  I was also part of pilot and mission operations training.
